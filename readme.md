<p align="left">In case number 2 (BalancedBracket), the code usage uses a linear time complexity type O(n) with n is the length of the string s. This linear complexity arises from the need to iterate through each character of the string exactly once to determine if the brackets are balanced.</p>


<br><br>-> The main operation involves iterating through each character of the string s exactly once. <br>-> Each character is processed individually to determine if it is an opening bracket (`'('`, `'['`, `{`) or a closing bracket (`')'`, `]`, `}`). This iteration is essential for checking the balance of brackets. <br>-> The loop continues until the end of the string, performing constant-time operations (`O(1)`) for each character.
