<p align="left">In case number 2 (BalancedBracket), the code usage uses a linear time complexity type O(n) with n is the length of the string s. This linear complexity arises from the need to iterate through each character of the string exactly once to determine if the brackets are balanced.</p>

<br>-> The main operation involves iterating through each character of the string s exactly once. <br>-> Each character is processed individually to determine if it is an opening bracket (`(`, `[`, `{`) or a closing bracket (`)`, `]`, `}`). This iteration is essential for checking the balance of brackets. <br>-> The loop continues until the end of the string, performing constant-time operations (`O(1)`) for each character.

<h3 align="left"> 1. Iteration through the String (`O(n)` Time Complexity): </h3>

<br>-> The main operation involves iterating through each character of the string s exactly once.
<br>-> Each character is processed individually to determine if it is an opening bracket (`(`, `[`, `{`) or a closing bracket (`)`, `]`, `}`). This iteration is essential for checking the balance of brackets.
<br>-> The loop continues until the end of the string, performing constant-time operations (O(1)) for each character.

<h3 align="left"> 2. Stack Operations:</h3>

<br>-> Pushing and popping operations on the stack (used to track opening brackets) are generally O(1) time complexity operations.
<br>-> The operations involve adding or removing elements from the stack, which has a constant time complexity relative to the number of elements involved.

<h3 align="left"> 3. Overall Time Complexity Analysis:</h3>

<br>-> Given that the primary operation is iterating through n characters in the string s, the time complexity is directly proportional to n, resulting in O(n) time complexity.
<br>-> This linear time complexity ensures that the algorithm scales efficiently with the size of the input string. As the string grows longer, the time taken to determine balance remains directly proportional to its length.

<h2 align="left"> Conclusion:</h2>
The choice of using a stack data structure and iterating through each character of the string once ensures that the algorithm remains efficient with O(n) time complexity. This efficiency is crucial for applications where checking the balance of brackets in expressions or parsing languages is necessary, as it allows for quick validation of syntactic correctness without unnecessary overhead.
